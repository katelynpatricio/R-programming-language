#This code analyzes movie profitability, comparing profits by genre, runtime, and budget while testing whether low-budget, poorly-rated movies can still be profitable.

#1. Do movies make money on average? How are you going to figure this out?
  
movies <- read.csv("movie_dataset.csv", header=TRUE)

movies$profit <- movies$revenue - movies$budget #Create a new column that reflects how much each movie makes

avg_profit <- t.test(movies$profit, mu = 0, na.rm = TRUE)

print(avg_profit)

#2. Do action movies cost more than other movie genres? Do they make more money on average? 
  
movies$mv_action <- grepl("Action",movies$genres) #Utilize the function grepl to find instances of "Action" found in movie genres

action_profit <- t.test(movies$profit ~ movies$mv_action, na.rm = TRUE)

print(action_profit)

action_cost <- t.test(movies$budget ~ movies$mv_action, na.rm = TRUE)

print(action_cost)

#3. Are long movies (over 2 hours) more or less profitable than shorter movies?

movies$mv_long <- movies$runtime > 120 #Create a new column that filters movies with a run time of longer than 120 minutes.

mv_length <- t.test(movies$profit ~ movies$mv_long, na.rm = TRUE)

print(mv_length)
  
#4. Is making bad movies but cheaply a possible path to riches?

#Create new variables to find the mean of movie budget and voter average
votes <- mean(movies$vote_average, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_budget <- mean(movies$budget, na.rm = TRUE)

#Create subset to get low budget and low voter average to indicate bad/poorly made movie
bad_movies <- subset(movies, vote_average < votes & budget < mean_budget) #Filter data set where both conditions are true

bad_movies$profit <- bad_movies$revenue - bad_movies$budget

bad_mv_profit <- t.test(bad_movies$profit, mu = 0, na.rm = TRUE)

print(bad_mv_profit)
